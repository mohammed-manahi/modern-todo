## Modern To do
### This repository as the term 'Modern' implies in the title is to explore new tools in backend and frontend.
#### The purpose of this simple project is twofold:
1. To delve into the new Identity API Endpoints that come with .NET 8 and use proprietary bearer token for authentication (Backend side).
2. To follow up on the updates in TanStack React Query v5 (especially useQuery and useMutation hooks) and discover the Mantine UI library (Frontend side).

#### Technology stack:
1. Backend: C#, ASP.NET, Web API, SQL Server, Entity Framework, Identity membership, LINQ Dynamic Core, Fluent API and Brevo SMTP provider.
2. Frontend: Javascript, React, useReducer hook with Context API, React Router, React Hook Form, React Query, Yup and Mantine UI.

#### Note: The frontend code needs more work on component abstraction, CSS modules management and Fetch API optimization.
